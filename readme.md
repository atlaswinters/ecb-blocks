A set of minimal and reponsive catalog blocks to use for your blog or e-commerce website.

Originally this began as static HTML and I am slowly working to convert them into WordPress Gutenberg blocks. Currently, it is 3 blocks you can use in variations to create a full page layout or just showcase a collection or post. Blocks do have linked images and the vertical grid does allow you to link each image to a different item or default to the main content link.

There is a demo site at: https://live-quicknotes-admin.pantheonsite.io
